**Key Features of Portals**

1. [**Custom Domains**](https://docs.stackerhq.com/stacker/workspace-portals-and-apps/portals/custom-domain): Each portal operates under its own domain, ensuring a personalized and secure experience. When you create a new portal zone, you can assign it a unique name, and the default URL will be formatted as `appname.stackerportal.com`. For a more branded experience, you also have the option to set a custom domain.&#x20;
2. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Portals allow you to share internal tables with external users, enabling them to access necessary data while maintaining the integrity of your internal systems. This ensures that sensitive information is safeguarded, and only relevant data is shared.
3. **Permanent Login Links**: To simplify user experience, portals enable the generation of permanent login links. This feature allows users to access their accounts without needing to sign in repeatedly, streamlining their interactions with your data.
4. **Security and Permissions**: Establishing proper permissions is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information. By configuring access controls, you can prevent inadvertent sharing of confidential data and ensure that users only see what they are authorized to access.
