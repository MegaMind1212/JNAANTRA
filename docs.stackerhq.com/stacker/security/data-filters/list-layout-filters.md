# List Layout Filters

Set filters on layouts to show varying information on different layouts:

1. Click **Edit Layout**
2. Select **Filters**
3. Apply your filters based on information on the table

For example, if I have a list of orders and want to show only those that are completed on one layout and on another layout I want to show those that are still pending I would duplicate my layout, then set one filter to "Status is Complete" and the other filter to "Status is Pending". This gives me two different lists of records and a navigation item for them allowing all users to see information quickly.&#x20;

**Note about using Layout Filters**

Filters are used to change the records that are displayed on the list view, but do not affect the permissions of the entire table. Users can access records through direct links to records, other list layouts and record lists, or the Stacker API.&#x20;

To completely close off a tables records to specific users use [Permissions](https://docs.stackerhq.com/stacker/security/add-user-permissions/create-or-edit-a-permission-rule).&#x20;
