# Dynamic Data Filters

### **Dynamic Data Filters**

You can apply dynamic filters to your linked fields.

For example, if you’re assigning Sales Managers to Meetings you can limit what Location this meeting can be held at based on where the Sales Manager works.&#x20;

The two fields need to be the same field type.
