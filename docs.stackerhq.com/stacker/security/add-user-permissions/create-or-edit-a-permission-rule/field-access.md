# Field Access

For every enabled field in your table, you can choose whether your users will be able to read the field, edit the field value or set the field value while creating a record. We automatically don't allow certain combinations. For example, you can't edit data that you can't read.

You can also enable or disable read, update, or create access for all fields in a table at once by toggling the checkboxes at the top of each column. A checkbox with a dash means that some but not all of the checkboxes in that column are ticked.
