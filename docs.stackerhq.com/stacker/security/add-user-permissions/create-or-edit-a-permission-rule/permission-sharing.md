# Permission Sharing

By default, permissions apply to all users.

You can restrict which roles a permission rule applies to, by switching from **Everyone** to **Some users**. If you're not using [User Roles](https://support.stackerhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409591860243-Set-up-User-Roles), then you will only be able to select the default **'User'**. This means that all users in your app will be given the same level of access. If you are using custom **User Roles**, you can choose to apply a permission rule to one or more of these Roles.

By creating [Multiple Permission Rules](https://support.stackerhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409598072979-Multiple-permission-rules), you can give different permissions to your users based on their Role - by applying different User Roles to different permission rules.
