Operating instructions define **what you want your agent to do**. This is where you provide clear, natural language prompts to guide the agent's actions.

#### Writing Effective Instructions

* Use plain language to describe the task, just like you would to a teammate.
* Include relevant field names and table names in your description.
* Be specific about what action you want the agent to take (e.g., "Find", "Summarize", "Check", "Send").

This task will be triggered based on the trigger you selected. Then it will use the instructions to complete the task, answer questions, or read documents.&#x20;

Depending on what operating instructions you give your agent you will need to choose the corresponding [tools](https://docs.stackerhq.com/stacker/ai-and-automations/ai-agents-beta/tools) to complete the tasks.&#x20;
