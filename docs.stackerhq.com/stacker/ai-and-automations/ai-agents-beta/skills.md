Use **Skills** to write focused prompts for your agents. Each Skill can include specific tools that are triggered only when the Skill is called. This allows you to break up complex instructions into smaller, manageable parts and ensures that tools only run in response to specific trigger prompts.

Skills can also be used within multiple agents, saving you time from needing to recreate them.&#x20;
