**Renderers** control how an agent’s response is displayed to the end user. While the agent generates the content, the renderer decides the format and presentation of that content based on the use case.

Renderers are especially useful when the same logic needs to be displayed differently—like showing results in a table for data queries or formatting a message as a polished email.

  Format and present structured data (like rows from a database) in a clean, readable layout—often as tables or lists.
* **Email**\
  Format the output as a properly styled email, ready to send to customers or stakeholders.
