# External IDs

Define an External ID field for each table. You can use any short text field as the External ID field. This is different than your record name or record ID field.

This will serve as a unique identifier for the record when exporting or importing data, using a [Make.com](http://make.com/) or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) automation to connect data to third party softwares.&#x20;

For example, when identifying a record in Hubspot to update in Stacker use the External IDs from Hubspot to update the corresponding record. This can also be used for linking records, if you had activities in Hubspot related to your contact, then you can load the Activity into Stacker and use the Hubspot Contact ID to link the records.
